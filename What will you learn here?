Hello, fellow git users. By now, I know that most of you probably know how to make a decent website with HTML, CSS & Javascript.
So, this one ain't for you rather for newcomers. Those who are new, you should know what is IDE and which IDE is best for which work.

As an example, for web development many prefer Webstorm or Visual Studio, due to their comprehensive feature sets and extensive plugin
ecosystems. In simple words, there are a lot of features that will help you in your journey to build a decent website maybe even better
than mine.

But first, you should remember not to compare your website design with others. Like you can see my index.html file and see how ugly it is
when compared to others. That was when I got back to web developing after learning Java and not learning to program anything :)  .

Now let's go step by step.

1. Install Visual Studio or Webstorm

2. Create a new project ( It's better to clone it from GitHub as it will help you to learn how to use GitHub with other IDE's as well)

3. Build a website ( any kind will do. It does not have to be good just write something or experiment with tags)

4. Try to keep your streak of coding like you can code after a day or after two days. ( Don't try to start to do daily, you may feel tired)

5. Keep learning new things from YouTube course or other peers.
